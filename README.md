### Hi, I'm Pedro!

I am a back-end developer who is always experimenting and learning new technologies and approaches to write good, clean and readable code.</a>
 
For languages, my greatest strength is in <strong> ABAP</strong>, however I am learning way around **Java Spring Boot** and **ReactJS**. I can also work with **C**  and *C++*.

For databases, I am most familiar with **PostgreSQL**. My plans are to study **DynamoDB** in the near future.

For automation and deployment, I am learning **Jenkins** and **Docker**.
